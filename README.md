# ./manage.py run_gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8000 --error-logfile=/var/log/gunicorn.log -D
```


Issues
======
if you get [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/varnish/secret' is because you are running django with a user that have not permission to read the file and must change permissions on varnish secret file

```
# sudo chmod 666 /etc/varnish/secret
```
